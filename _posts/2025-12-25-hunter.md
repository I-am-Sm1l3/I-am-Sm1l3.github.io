## Objective:
You are an operator for the Hack Smarter Red Team, currently conducting a black-box assessment on a client's external login portal. As part of the initial reconnaissance phase, our OSINT analysts have compiled a list of potential usernames. You need to identify which one is a valid username for the web application.

We are given a file called `usernames.txt`.

## Recon:
### Nmap Scan:
```console
$ nmap -T4 -sC -sV -Pn 10.1.145.51
```
Result:
![Nmap Scan Result]({{ page.img_path }}Nmap.png)

We can see that there are two ports open: "22" and "80".

In the scope defined, the target is a web server running on port 80.

### Dirscan:
```console
$ dirsearch -u 10.1.145.51
```
Output:

![Result]({{ page.img_path }}dirsearch.png)

Dirsearch found two directories: "/login" and "/reset".

### Visiting /reset:
![Result]({{ page.img_path }}reset.png)

On the reset page, we can enter a username to reset the link.

Let's try the username "admin".
![Result]({{ page.img_path }}admin.png)

We can see that the response says that an email will be sent if the user exists.

### Using ffuf:
We send a request again and capture it using "burpsuite" to use it for "ffuf".
```console
$ ffuf -w usernames.txt -u http://10.1.216.45/reset -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=FUZZ'
```
It returns nothing useful. Maybe we could see something by checking response time, because if the email is being sent to the valid user, the response would be taking more time than the usual 100 - 200ms.

### Identifying the user:
```console
$ ffuf -w usernames.txt -u http://10.1.145.51/reset -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=FUZZ' -ft '<800'
```
Output:
![Result]({{ page.img_path }}fuff_time.png)

We filter for usernames that took longer than 800ms. And successfully identify the username that took the longest time.
